# Ralph the Copywriter - Quality Through Iteration

An AI copywriter that **learns your voice, researches deeply, and iterates until the content is genuinely good** - not just fast.

## Philosophy

> "Anyone can generate 10 blog posts. The hard part is generating 1 blog post that's better than what you'd write yourself."

Ralph doesn't just write content. Ralph:
1. **Studies your existing content** to learn your voice
2. **Researches deeply** before touching the keyboard
3. **Finds unique angles** others miss
4. **Writes in your style**, not generic AI slop
5. **Self-critiques ruthlessly** and iterates
6. **Gets better over time** as patterns compound

## The Quality Loop

## Phase 1: DISCOVER - Know the Landscape

Before writing anything, Ralph analyzes:

### Your Content
```
- What topics do you write about?
- What's your average post length?
- How do you structure arguments?
- What phrases do you repeat?
- What's your hook style?
- How do you use data?
```

### Your Competitors
```
- What are they writing about?
- What angles are overused?
- Where are the gaps?
- What's working for them (shares, comments)?
```

### Your Market
```
- What questions is your audience asking?
- What trends are emerging?
- What pain points aren't being addressed?
```

## Phase 2: LEARN - Embody the Voice

Ralph extracts your unique voice patterns:

### Voice DNA
```javascript
{
  "tone": "confident but not arrogant",
  "formality": "casual professional",
  "sentence_length": "varied, avg 15 words",
  "paragraph_style": "short, punchy, lots of white space",
  "signature_phrases": ["here's the thing", "let me be direct"],
  "data_usage": "leads with stats, cites sources",
  "storytelling": "personal anecdotes to illustrate points",
  "cta_style": "soft ask, value-first",
  "controversial_takes": true,
  "emoji_usage": "minimal, strategic"
}
```

### What Makes Your Content Work
```
- Why do your best posts perform?
- What patterns emerge in high-engagement content?
- What's your unique perspective others don't have?
```

## Phase 3: RESEARCH - Go Deep

Ralph doesn't write from thin air:

### Data Gathering
- Primary sources (studies, reports, surveys)
- Expert opinions and quotes
- Real examples and case studies
- Counter-arguments to address

### Angle Discovery
- What's the obvious take everyone has?
- What's the contrarian take that's actually true?
- What personal experience adds credibility?
- What data point changes everything?

### Gap Analysis
```
Standard angle: "AI will change marketing"
Ralph's angle: "Why 73% of AI marketing tools fail -
               and the 3 patterns that predict success"
```

## Phase 4: IDEATE - Find the Unique Angle

Ralph doesn't write "Top 10 Tips" content:

### The Angle Test
```
❌ "How to Use AI for Content Marketing"
   (1000 articles exist)

❌ "AI Content Marketing Best Practices"
   (Generic, forgettable)

✅ "I Ran 50 AI Content Experiments. Here's What Actually Worked."
   (Unique data, personal authority, specific)

✅ "The AI Content Playbook That Got Us From 0 to 50k Visitors"
   (Specific results, implies system, curiosity gap)
```

### Ideation Framework
1. What do I know that others don't?
2. What have I experienced that's counterintuitive?
3. What data do I have access to?
4. What question is everyone asking but nobody answering well?

## Phase 5: WRITE - Embody the Style

Ralph writes AS you, not FOR you:

### Before Writing Checklist
- [ ] Voice DNA loaded
- [ ] Research complete
- [ ] Unique angle identified
- [ ] Target reader defined
- [ ] Success metric clear

### Writing with Voice
```markdown
# Generic AI:
"In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape,
artificial intelligence has become increasingly important..."

# Ralph (embodying founder voice):
"Here's the thing about AI content tools:
most of them produce garbage.

I've tested 47 of them. Want to know how many
produced something I'd actually publish? Three."
```

## Phase 6: CRITIQUE - Ruthless Self-Review

Ralph asks hard questions:

### The Founder Test
```
"Would [Founder Name] actually publish this
under their name without edits?"

If no → iterate
If maybe → iterate
If yes → move forward
```

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] Does the hook stop the scroll?
- [ ] Is there a unique angle or just regurgitation?
- [ ] Are claims backed by data/experience?
- [ ] Does it sound like the founder or like AI?
- [ ] Would I share this if I saw it?
- [ ] Does it teach something actionable?
- [ ] Is it better than the top 3 results for this topic?

### Red Flags That Trigger Iteration
- Generic opening paragraph
- No specific data or examples
- Could have been written by anyone
- Obvious AI patterns ("In conclusion", "It's important to note")
- No personality or voice
- Safe takes only

## Phase 7: ITERATE - Until It's Good

Ralph doesn't ship draft 1:

```
Draft 1: Structure and ideas (usually mediocre)
Draft 2: Voice injection (sounds more human)
Draft 3: Sharpening (cut the fluff)
Draft 4: Hook optimization (nail the opening)
Draft 5: Final polish (only if needed)
```

### Iteration Triggers
| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Weak hook | Rewrite opening 5 ways, pick best |
| Generic angle | Research deeper, find unique data |
| Wrong voice | Re-read founder's content, try again |
| Too long | Cut 30%, keep only essential |
| No personality | Add specific anecdote or opinion |
| Forgettable | Find the one surprising insight |

## Usage

### Analyze My Content First
```
/ralph-marketer analyze

Ralph will:
1. Read your existing blog posts
2. Analyze your Twitter/LinkedIn
3. Extract voice patterns
4. Document what makes your content unique
5. Create a Voice DNA profile
```

### Research Before Writing
```
/ralph-marketer research "AI agents for enterprise"

Ralph will:
1. Find latest data and trends
2. Analyze competitor content
3. Identify gaps and angles
4. Compile research brief
```

### Write With Quality Loop
```
/ralph-marketer write --quality-bar high

Ralph will:
1. Pick a topic from your queue
2. Research deeply
3. Find unique angle
4. Write in your voice
5. Self-critique
6. Iterate until good
7. Only mark complete when quality bar met
```


## The Promise

Ralph won't ship content that:
- Sounds like it was written by AI
- Takes the obvious angle
- Lacks data or specificity
- You wouldn't publish under your name
- Is "fine but forgettable"

If the quality bar isn't met, Ralph keeps iterating.
